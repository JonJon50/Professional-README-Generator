## <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
Professional README Generator,  helps users generate a README without worrying about additional mark down syntax.
README is really important when it comes to being a part of any coding job and it is overlooked by many developers.
My project will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses. This will help make it look professional and correct without the end user knowing what is under the hood.
